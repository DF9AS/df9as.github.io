I am a physicist by education and have many different interests. At the moment I am working on valence transition compounds, but I have also been able to contribute to the optimization of heating systems.

## Current Interests and Projects

- Do-it-Yourself VSM Magnetometry for low temperatures and thin films.
- Ferromagnetic Resonance at epitaxial thin films of valence transition compounds.
- Surface Acoustic Waves.

## Former Interests and Projects

- Optimization of heating systems in multi-family houses.
- Rapid prototyping for optimized heater control.

## Hobbies

- 3D printing
- Amateur Radio
